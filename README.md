As the Treasurer of [Contemporary Choir](https://www.exeterguild.org/societies/contemporarychoir/) (a University of Exeter Students' Guild society), I've found myself spending quite a bit of time working with various spreadsheets and data from various different sources. As a result, I've started writing scripts to help automate some tasks (e.g. checking & storing the society ledger).

`ledger_fetcher.py` allows you to download the society ledger from eXpense365 to your computer (instead of having to use the app). It can also then convert it from a PDF to an XLSX spreadsheet (using [pdftoexcel.com](https://www.pdftoexcel.com/)) and then upload the newly-converted spreadsheet to a pre-existing Google Sheet (as a new sheet within a spreadsheet). *Please note that I'm not affiliated with pdftoexcel.com and that use of their service is bound by their terms & privacy policy - it's just a handy service that I've found can convert the ledger accurately.*
